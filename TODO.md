List of minor tasks to be done soon or already in progress:

* Make errors in .jade files show on-screen in development and not crash the server
* Clean up API - get rid of url_lib
* Fix errors generated in Firefox when server connection is dropped (does not affect reconnect) 
* Refactor coffee compile so we don't repeat ourselves
