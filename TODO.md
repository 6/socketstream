List of minor tasks to be done soon or already in progress:

* Clean up API code - get rid of url_lib
* Fix errors generated in Firefox when server connection is dropped (does not affect reconnect) 
* Refactor coffee compile so we don't repeat ourselves
* Make sure "#{system_path}/cached/lib.min.js" can be read when npm package is installed instead of linked
